Many of the animal species that are subject to these activities are commonly referred to as “exotic”, as they are not native to the region and must be captured in, and then transported from, other parts of the world.
	  	    <br>
			<span class="chunk">The phenomenon is perhaps most evident on social media platforms, where owners flaunt their animals as symbols of status, wealth, and power (in the Arab World, the use of pets to convey these qualities has antecedents in royal menageries, dating as far back as 3500-BCE Egypt)(<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkjx93/rich-people-are-obsessed-with-owning-exotic-animals">1</a>). In the UAE, highly popular Instagram accounts exist that are dedicated almost exclusively to images of exotic pets (an example that is constantly mentioned in articles on this subject is Humaid Albuqaish’s account)(<a href="https://www.instagram.com/humaidalbuqaish/">2</a>). As stated in a 2016 <i>Vice</i> article (<a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkjx93/rich-people-are-obsessed-with-owning-exotic-animals">3</a>):
			"Today, owning an exotic animal is almost a rite of passage for the rich and the famous. On social media sites such as Instagram and Tinder, chained tigers and cheetahs are flaunted next to Lamborghinis, Louis Vuitton bags, and luxury yachts; mere accessories to the one percent who can afford them."
			</span>
			<br>
			<span class="chunk">But social media also plays a critical role in the trafficking and selling of these animals, as they allow dealers to illegally advertise them to potential buyers. After passing a law banning exotic pets in 2016 - 2017, the UAE experienced a surge in online activities of this kind. As described by the Acting Director of the Biodiversity Department at the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, “online channels provide illegal wildlife smugglers with an unregulated, anonymous and virtually unlimited outreach” (<a href="https://www.arabianbusiness.com/culture-society/413336-the-business-of-wildlife">4</a>). </span>
			<br>
			<span class="chunk">Cheetahs are among the most popular wild pets in the country, and as described by a 2018 <i>National Geographic</i> article (<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2018/11/fighting-cheetah-trade-somaliland/">5</a>):
			"You only have to look at one to understand why. With their long legs, slender bodies, distinctive teardrop markings, and coats that look as if they’d been designed by Louis Vuitton, cheetahs are the supermodels of the feline world. They’re also the least aggressive. Try putting a jaguar in your luxury SUV, and it’ll rip your throat out."
			</span>
			<span class="chunk">Calculations point to about 300 cubs smuggled every year from Africa; their mortality rate is around 70% (<a href="https://www.arabianbusiness.com/culture-society/413336-the-business-of-wildlife">6</a>). The species is increasingly closer to becoming extinct (<a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/01/wildlife-watch-united-arab-emirates-ban-exotic-pets-cheetahs/">7</a>), with only about 7000 cheetahs in the wild. The smuggled animals are negatively impacted not only by the harsh conditions they face when taken and transported from their natural habitats (for example, in some animals “the trauma results in capture myopathy, a disease causing muscle damage from extreme struggle or stress, followed by death”)(<a href="https://www.arabianbusiness.com/culture-society/413336-the-business-of-wildlife">8</a>), but also by the treatment they receive from their owners, who are often not aware of their pets’ needs or lose interest in the animals once they reach adulthood. </span>
			<span class="chunk">Given the cultural roots of this practice in the UAE, and in general, the human psychological impulse behind the taming of animals (as explained by Yi-Fu Tuan in the text Dominance and Affection)(<a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300102086/dominance-and-affection">9</a>), creating work that convinces users of the negative impact of wildlife smuggling and ownership is not an easy task. Charles Siebert, a professor at New York University Abu Dhabi and well-known writer for his pieces on animal behavior and human-animal relationships (<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/author/charles-siebert/">10</a>), argues that the best approach to change a reader/user’s perspective is to incite empathy by creating a connection between the subject (animal) and the reader/user (human). Preaching the message is not effective; the user must sense a degree of friendliness in the work in order to be willing to interact with it, and through images and a narrative, the connection can be established.</span>
			<span class="chunk">Thus, I chose to create a “guide to the humane ownership of exotic species” that imitates the format and images of a high-fashion magazine (where products from the aforementioned Louis Vuitton, for example, would feature), but which quickly reveals to be self-reflective. The guide intends to show readers how to obtain what they want (exotic pets) in the most humane way possible (arguing that this is beneficial to the reader), but the guide itself begins to realize there is no way to do this, hopefully convincing the reader of the same conclusion throughout the process of discovery. </span>
			<span class="chunk">Real images from Instagram and smuggling activities (made into short animations), facts about this issue and about cheetahs, and a hint of satire characterize the work.</span>
